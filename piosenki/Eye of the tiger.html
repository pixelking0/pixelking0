							Risin' up, back on the street</br>
							Did my time, took my chances</br>
							Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet</br>
							Just a man and his will to survive
							</br></br>
							So many times, it happens too fast</br>
							You change your passion for glory</br>
							Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past</br>
							You must fight just to keep them alive
							</br></br>
							Chorus:</br>
							It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</br>
							Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</br>
							And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</br>
							And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
							</br></br>
							Face to face, out in the heat</br>
							Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry</br>
							They stack the odds 'till we take to the street</br>
							For we kill with the skill to survive
							</br></br>
							Chorus:</br>
							It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</br>
							Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</br>
							And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</br>
							And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
							</br></br>
							Risin' up, straight to the top</br>
							Have the guts, got the glory</br>
							Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop</br>
							Just a man and his will to survive
							</br></br>
							Chorus:</br>
							It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</br>
							Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</br>
							And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</br>
							And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger
							</br></br>
							The eye of the tiger (repeats out)..
