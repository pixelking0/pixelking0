							Once upon a time not so long ago
							</br></br>
							Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike</br>
							He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough</br>
							Gina works the diner all day working for her man</br>
							She brings home her pay, for love, for love
							</br></br>
							She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got</br>
							It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not</br>
							We've got each other and that's a lot for love</br>
							We'll give it a shot
							</br></br>
							Woah, we're half way there</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer
							</br></br>
							Tommy's got his six-string in hock</br>
							Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk</br>
							So tough, it's tough</br>
							Gina dreams of running away</br>
							When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers</br>
							Baby, it's okay, someday
							</br></br>
							We've got to hold on to what we've got</br>
							It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not</br>
							We've got each other and that's a lot for love</br>
							We'll give it a shot
							</br></br>
							Woah, we're half way there</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Livin' on a prayer
							</br></br>
							Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not</br>
							You live for the fight when it's all that you've got</br>
							Woah, we're half way there</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer
							</br></br>
							Woah, we're half way there</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer
							</br></br>
							Woah, we're half way there</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
							Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
							Woah, livin' on a prayer
