							They came for him one winter's night.</br>
							Arrested, he was bound.</br>
							They said there'd been a robbery,</br>
							His pistol had been found.
							</br></br>
							They marched him to the station house,</br>
							he waited for the dawn.</br>
							And as they led him to the dock,</br>
							He knew that he'd been wronged.</br>
							"You stand accused of robbery,"</br>
							He heard the bailiff say.</br>
							He knew without an alibi,</br>
							Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and far away,</br>
							For ten long years he'll count the days.</br>
							Over the mountains and the seas,</br>
							A prisoner's life for him there'll be.
							</br></br>
							He knew that it would cost him dear,</br>
							But yet he dare not say.</br>
							Just where he'd been that fateful night,</br>
							A secret it must stay.</br>
							He had to fight back tears of rage.</br>
							His heart beat like a drum.</br>
							For with the wife of his best friend,</br>
							He spent his final night of freedom.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and far away,</br>
							He swears he will return one day.</br>
							Far from the mountains and the seas,</br>
							Back in her arms is where he'll be.</br>
							Over the hills and far away.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and,</br>
							Over the hills and,</br>
							Over the hills and far away.
							</br></br>
							Each night within his prison cell,</br>
							He looks out through the bars.</br>
							He reads the letters that she wrote.</br>
							One day he'll know the taste of freedom.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and far away,</br>
							She prays he will return one day.</br>
							As sure as the rivers reach the seas,</br>
							Back in his arms is where she'll be.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and far away,</br>
							He swears he will return one day.</br>
							Far from the mountains and the seas,</br>
							Back in her arms is where he'll be.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills and far away,</br>
							She prays he will return one day.</br>
							As sure as the rivers reach the seas,</br>
							Back in his arms is where she'll be.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills,</br>
							Over the hills and far away.
							</br></br>
							Over the hills,</br>
							Over the hills and far away.
